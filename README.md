So this is the final decision.

I want to send the confirmation email to the students however their account will lead to a page that tells 
them to wait for confirmation from their teacher. On the teacher's dashboard, 
the student's details will appear for the teacher to approve them. 

After the teacher's approval, the student will be allowed to view other pages. 


That sounds like a well-thought-out workflow! Here's how you can implement it in Django:

Send Confirmation Email to Students: When a student registers, send a confirmation email to the student's email address. 
The email should include a message indicating that their registration is pending approval from their teacher.

Student Account Page: Create a page for student accounts where they can log in and view their account details. 
On this page, display a message informing them that their account is pending approval from their teacher.

Teacher Dashboard: Create a dashboard for teachers where they can view pending student registrations. 
This dashboard should display the details of each student who has registered and provide options for the 
teacher to approve or reject each registration.

Approval Workflow: Implement the approval workflow so that when a teacher approves a student registration, 
the student's account status is updated to approved. This can be done by updating a field in the Student 
model to indicate the approval status.

Allow Student Access: Once a student's registration is approved by their teacher, they should be allowed 
to access other pages on the site. You can implement logic in your views to check the approval status of 
the student's account before granting access to certain pages.

By following these steps, you can create a workflow where students receive confirmation emails upon registration, 
their accounts are pending approval from their teacher until approval is granted, and they can access other pages 
on the site once their registration is approved. 
This approach ensures that students are informed about the status of their registration and allows teachers 
to easily manage and approve student registrations.
